Today will be only  2 tips but I will definetly upload more soon!
if your computer will not turn on try pluging it in to a charger and pressing the power button. If not you can try searching it up on YouTube and type waht specific device you are using. IF your computer is still not turning on then he might have to take it in to a computer store or try contacting a company.
when  ur computer starts glitching just shut it down completely and try turning it on agai. When you open your computer and it is still glitching you will have to search on YouTube or contact someone you know that can help you out.

More tricks will be coming soon!!!:)
